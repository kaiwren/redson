# Redson

Redson is a lightweight client side MVC framework written in Ruby specifically for Rails applications. It uses the Opal Ruby to js compiler.

It builds on top of jQuery's proven cross-platform implementations of async http calls, DOM lookup+manipulation and the observer pattern to ensure compatibility and performance.

It's pretty much an experiment at the moment.
